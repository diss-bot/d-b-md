## Diss-Bot
Project Pitch: our idea is going to implement a Discord bot that will do a few things: 
1. It will track user data, and save it to a MongoDB instance. 
2. It will be able to be called and check data when asked, and will return a variety of different responses based on the data.
  - If you are comparing 2 users, and their previous games, it will either compliment the winner or insult the loser
  - Compare the discord server users and keep track of who is 'the top' user, based of certain criteria (like points in a given game)
  - Ranking system, to give you the 'top 3 users' from their experience over the last week

### Summary of idea
A bot that is helpful in tracking user data, comparing users.. and dissing people.

### Problem Domain
We wanted an easy way to keep track of user data in discord, and compare those users to one another.. and also an easy way to talk trash to your friends!

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
This is getting an app that is working on Discord for at least one game (right now we have a few games we would like to incorporate), that tracks and compares user data, and can be prompted to talk trash on our friends!
